Block 1 title: Current Message Series
Block 1 text: "“Alongside” - We are living in a hyper-digital age. We are flooded
  with more information than we can file, more news than we can react to, more advertisements
  than we can read, and more online relationships and cyber-connections than we can
  maintain. Yet we are the loneliest and most isolated we have ever been. Neighbors
  don't know neighbors. We look for our value by comparing it to the carefully manicured
  versions of humanity we see online. We need real connections with real people. We
  long for genuineness, honesty, & authentic friendships - we're wired to experience
  life with others, to know and be known - we need community... and the need is urgent.
  Join us for this message series beginning Sunday, Sept. 29th at 10am."
