Block 1 text: "“Ain't In There” - Maybe your Grandma said it, maybe it was advice
  that made you feel better, or maybe you’ve just heard it so much, you assumed it
  was true. We hear and say things that seem like they’re in the Bible… but are they?
  Join us beginning Sunday, February 16th as we unpack four commonly quoted statements
  and find out what the Bible really says."
