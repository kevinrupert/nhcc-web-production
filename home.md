Block 1 text: "“Doppelgänger — Confronting Your Shadow”, starting this Sunday. We
  all have things we say we believe and are important to us. But what if our beliefs
  and ethics weren’t defined by what we say, but instead by how we actually live our
  daily lives?  What stories would our lives and decisions tell about us and what
  is important to us? \n"
