Block 1 title: Current Message Series
Block 1 text: "“Are We There Yet?”  We’ve all been on those adventurous road trips—maybe
  with family, maybe with a group of friends…the landscapes may vary, but the experiences
  and “markers” along the way become part of who we are.  The scriptures give us a
  picture of faith as an ongoing journey, and here at NHCC, we get to take that adventure
  together!  This message series will look at some of the most essential and foundational
  “markers” we want to let shape us as a church along this shared journey, as well
  as challenge us personally to become more like Jesus.\n"
