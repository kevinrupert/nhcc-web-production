About headline: "“Are We There Yet?”  We’ve all been on those adventurous road trips—maybe
  with family, maybe with a group of friends…the landscapes may vary, but the experiences
  and “markers” along the way become part of who we are.  The scriptures give us a
  picture of faith as an ongoing journey, and here at NHCC, we get to take that adventure
  together!  Join us starting January 6 as we kick off a 5 week message series that
  will look at some of the most essential and foundational “markers” we want to let
  shape us as a church along this shared journey, as well as challenge us personally
  to continue to take steps following Jesus in the process."
