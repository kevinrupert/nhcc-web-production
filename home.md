Block 1 text: "“Deep & Wide” - When we are willing to open our eyes and look at the
  vast picture of God’s church—globally and throughout history—we see an illustration
  of incredible depth, beauty and richness that far exceeds the confines of any church
  building. Join us starting next Sunday for this important series as we look at some
  of the scriptural and historical richness that makes us who we are…and what it calls
  us to be moving forward."
