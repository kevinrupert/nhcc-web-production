Block 1 title: Current Message Series
Block 1 text: The idea of "The Seven Deadly Sins” has been around for a long time—their
  classification was loosely developed by 3rd century monks—but their strongholds
  in our modern world are as current as ever.  Join us beginning June 2nd for this
  summer series where we will have some fun pairing each sin with a corresponding
  social media platform or online outlet…but we will also seek to courageously address
  these destructive tendencies in our own lives.
