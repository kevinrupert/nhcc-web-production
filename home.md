Block 1 title: SERVICE CANCELLED FOR 1/20
Block 1 text: |-
  As you have likely seen/heard, the National Weather Service is issuing a Winter Storm Watch for this weekend. It will likely involve combinations of freezing rain, ice, and substantial snowfall.

  Therefore, due to the incoming storm AND the timing, NHCC has decided to CANCEL CHURCH SERVICE THIS Sunday morning, January 20, 2019. We believe it is in the best interest of the church community to consider the potential safety risks incurred by having a service. This early decision gives us ample time to communicate and prevent anyone from making an unnecessary trip, but it also helps to ease the burden of the ongoing renovations, as some of our contractors will be moving the pews for us.

  **IMPORTANT NOTE: The Youth Event planned for Sunday evening WILL still happen. We will notify individuals by email of there is a change.**
