Block 1 title: Current Message Series
Block 1 text: We all need “Whitespace” in our lives—like margin on paper, or like
  slack in the chain—Yet too often, the foundational things our lives most desperately
  need are left out because our “whitespace” is already filled.  Join us for this
  five week series as we seek to evaluate and re-order our priorities to make room
  for what matters.
