Block 1 title: Upcoming Message Series
Block 1 text: "“The Great Christmas Giveaway” - This holiday season, amidst a flood
  of consumerism, materialism and greed, we will intentionally aim to encounter and
  live out God’s message of hope, renewal and healing through giving and serving…the
  same message given to humanity 2,000 years ago through a baby born in Bethlehem.
  Be sure and join us NEXT Sunday, Dec 1 as we kick off this series with our Meal
  Pack Event. See Events page for details. Messages begin Sunday, December 8th."
