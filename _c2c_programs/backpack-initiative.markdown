Each week we feed close to 200 students in the North Hills School District who are at risk of going hungry over the weekend by packing bags full of nutritious meals and snacks to be placed in studentsâ€™ backpacks for the next weekend. NHCC packs the 2nd Sunday of each Month immediately following worship. Outside group are invited to pack the 4th Monday of each month. To get on the schedule contact katie@northhillschristian.church
