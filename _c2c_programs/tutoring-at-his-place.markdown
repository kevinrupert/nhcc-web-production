Each week we encourage members of our church to tutor at His Place Community Center in Pittsburghâ€™s Spring Hill neighborhood. This service opportunity reaches outside of our bounds to help students get assistance with their homework and put them on track to earn the Pittsburgh Promise scholarship and more.
