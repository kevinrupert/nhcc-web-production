date: 2019-07-15 11:08:00 Z
position: 17
speaker: Toney Salva - *Due to technical difficulties, the beginning of the sermon
  is missing.  Toney is speaking about how envy is a problem for all of us, especially
  in the US.  Our first instincts are often the opposite of what God would have them
  be.  Toney then references 1 Corinthians 13:4-7, showing us that envy is the opposite
  of love and that the Corinthians had a big envy problem.  The recording picks up
  as he is discussing these verses.
