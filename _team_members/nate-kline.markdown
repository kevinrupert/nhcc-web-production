Nate has served at NHCC since 2012. With more than a decade of ministry experience, Nate works with students and group ministries. He is  an alum of Cincinnati Christian University holding a B.A. in Biblical Studies (‘11) and a M.A. in New Testament Studies (‘14). Nate is married to Michelle and they have two children, Elliot and Mary-Kate.

When Nate isn’t at NHCC, you can find him running at North Park, downtown or in your local marathon. He’s also a big fan of our Pittsburgh Steelers and Penguins, but his baseball heart still bleeds for the Reds.
