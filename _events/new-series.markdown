“Are We There Yet?”  We’ve all been on those adventurous road trips—maybe with family, maybe with a group of friends…the landscapes may vary, but the experiences and “markers” along the way become part of who we are.  The scriptures give us a picture of faith as an ongoing journey, and here at NHCC, we get to take that adventure together!  Join us starting January 6 as we kick off a 5 week message series that will look at some of the most essential and foundational “markers” we want to let shape us as a church along this shared journey, as well as challenge us personally to continue to take steps following Jesus in the process.
