When we are willing to open our eyes and look at the vast picture of God’s church—globally and throughout history—we see an illustration of incredible depth, beauty and richness that far exceeds the confines of any church building. Join us for this important series as we look at some of the scriptural and historical richness that makes us who we are…and what it calls us to be moving forward.
