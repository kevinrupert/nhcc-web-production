We are so accustomed to communicating in superlatives and extremes, aren’t we? “I am SO INCREDIBLY hungry!” “This is the WORST coffee ever!” “That new Netflix series is LIFE-CHANGING!” We have cheapened what it really means to be great… and what it really means to be lacking. In this series, we will look at who God is in contrast with what we often let define and shape us… and ultimately see what is Greater, and what is Lesser.
