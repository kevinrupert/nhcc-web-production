The idea of "The Seven Deadly Sins” has been around for a long time—their classification was loosely developed by 3rd century monks—but their strongholds in our modern world are as current as ever.  Join us beginning June 2nd for this 7-week summer series that will have some fun pairing each sin with a corresponding social media platform or online outlet…but as we also seek to courageously address these destructive tendencies in our own lives.
