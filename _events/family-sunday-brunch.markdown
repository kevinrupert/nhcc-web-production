On Sunday 12/29, we will use our 10 am service time to do what the book of Acts says the disciples did in the early church: “they broke bread ... and ate together with glad and sincere hearts.” For those in town over Christmas week, join us for this special all-family brunch and communion gathering. Everyone attending should simply bring a dish to share.
