NHCC is hosting a neighborhood trunk sale in our lot on SEPTEMBER 21, 2019 from 8-2 pm.  What is a trunk sale, you may ask?  Our numerous nearby neighborhoods are invited to participate by reserving parking spaces to sell their personal yard sale type items, thereby creating a parking lot filled with mini-yard sales.  We are located at a high-visibility intersection at the corner of Thompson Run Rd and Amity Rd in Ross Township. In addition to this open flea-market style community sale, food trucks and an inflatable for the kids will be available onsite.  Come and find those treasures and deals youâ€™ve been looking for!  

NO EARLY BIRDS, PLEASE.
