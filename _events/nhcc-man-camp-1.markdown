North Hills Chrisitan Church is proud to present MAN CAMP 2018. The 3rd Saturdays in June, July, and August will give all our men of all ages an opportunity to escape the yard work and gather with the guys.

June 16 : Ax Throwing at THROW on McKnight Road ($20)

July 21 : Donuts & Wheels (A free bike ride on Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Hertiage Trail + $5 for donuts at Peace, Love and Little Donuts in the Strip District)

August 18 : We Have the Meats BBQ (Free)
A whole summer of fun for just $25, not bad, right? Sign up today.
