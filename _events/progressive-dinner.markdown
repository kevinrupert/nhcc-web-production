What is a Progressive Dinner? We're glad you asked. Students and sponsors will meet at NHCC and visit 3 different homes throughout the course of the evening. They will begin at the first home for appetizers, move onto their 2nd stop for a main course and wrap up the evening at yet a 3rd venue for dessert and a white elephant gift exchange. Not sure what to bring for the White Elephant gift? Find something inexpensive at a store or a used item at home and wrap it up. It can be anything!!

Please meet promptly at **5pm** at the church parking lot. Transportation will be provided by our adult sponsors. **Pick up at 8:15pm** at the church parking lot.
