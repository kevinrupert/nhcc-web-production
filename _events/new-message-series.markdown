We are living in a hyper-digital age: we are flooded with more information than we can file, more news than we can react to, more advertisements than we can read, and more online relationships and cyber-connections than we can maintain.  Yet we are the loneliest and most isolated we have ever been.  Jesus calls us out of a life of isolation, image management, and self-reliance and into a life of joy, honesty and interdependence.
