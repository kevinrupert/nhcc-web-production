We are partnering with Lifeline Christian Mission to pack and prep ship-ready family meal packets for Lifelineâ€™s Honduras mission community. We will be using the bulk of our regular 10am Sunday worship gathering to serve together in this way. Kids programming will be available as usual up through 3rd grade; kids 4th grade and higher can participate with their families. Please be sure and join us for this important Sunday.
