"A Night to Remember" is a formal, red carpet style evening of celebration, dinner and dancing for those special guests in our community who have developmental, physical, or mental disabilities. This event is underwritten by Discovery Christian Church, and takes a lot of volunteers to pull off.  NHCC is partnering with Discovery to provide volunteer support. Registration is now closed, but we invite you to join us at the red carpet on May 19th as we cheer on our special guests. Be there before 5pm to get a good spot and don't forget to invite someone to come with you!
