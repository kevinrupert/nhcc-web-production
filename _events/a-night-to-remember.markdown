"A Night to Remember" is a formal, red carpet style evening of celebration, dinner and dancing for those special guests in our community who have developmental, physical, or mental disabilities. This event is underwritten by Discovery Christian Church, and takes a lot of volunteers to pull off.  NHCC is partnering with Discovery to provide volunteer support, and we want you to join us!  Sign up below to be a buddy or for one of the many other volunteer positions. Questions? Contact the office.
