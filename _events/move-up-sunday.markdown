Next Sunday, June 9th, all children going into 1st grade & 4th grade will move into their new classes on Sunday morning.  Students going into 6th grade can begin to attend NHCC Student Nights. They are also welcome to continue to attend class on Sunday mornings through the summer, or join the Teaching Team.  Please contact Katie if you have questions or if your child would like to join the teaching team.
