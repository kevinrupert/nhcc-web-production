New to NHCC? Or been coming for a little while, but looking to get to know us better? Join us after service on Sunday, January 27th for an informal time to meet staff, ask any questions, and enjoy a warm bowl of soup to take the edge off the winter chill. Mark your Connect Card on Sunday and let us know you're interested, or email the church office at info@northhillschristian.church.
