THIS Sunday, May 12th is Mother’s Day…and to celebrate, we want to invite everyone to a pre-service brunch downstairs from 9-10am.  Bring Moms, bring your families, bring your friends and stop by before service for some breakfast munchies served by our NHCC men. You can stay for as much or as little of that hour as you’d like!
