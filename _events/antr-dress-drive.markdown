On May 17th, Discovery Christian Church will be hosting A Night To Remember and they always provide dresses for the female guests and need our help!  We will be collecting gently used gowns in the office until March 15th.  Plus size dresses are needed most.  Please ensure your dresses are clean and in good condition. No wedding dresses, shoes, or jewelry please. Questions? Contact Sarah at Sarah@northhillschristian.church
