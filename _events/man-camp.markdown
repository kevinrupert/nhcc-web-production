Hey guys—In our fast-paced, digitally-captive world, we’re all hungry for some face-to-face connection, right? For 24 hours this October, we’re getting away from it all to a beautiful camp about an hour north to enjoy some wide open outdoor spaces, connect with each other, and have some honest conversations about life and faith. Cost is $75 and includes lodging, meals and recreation.  Sign up [HERE](https://discovertogether.ccbchurch.com/goto/forms/272/responses/new) or contact Ethan at Ethan@northhillschristian.church with any questions. The deadline to register is Sunday, 9/29
