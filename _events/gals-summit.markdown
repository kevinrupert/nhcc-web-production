Our adventures are often not the ones that we have chosen. Life goes into unplanned directions and even takes us to places that feel, well...‘out of our element’. But what if we welcomed those adventures? WHAT IF we took the leap into the unknown in order to gain perspective, learn new things, grow, and actually seek the adventure?
 
You won’t want to miss this weekend of worship, fellowship, and moments where we embrace the adventure. The cost for the weekend is $75 and covers lodging, meals, and main events. 

Join us for this great weekend by signing up below!
