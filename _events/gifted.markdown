Children up through 6th grade and their families are invited to join us in our Winter Wonderland Saturday, December 14, 2019. Wander through our maze of decorated spaces and create crafts, decorate cookies, play games, enjoy science experiemnts, experience storytelling, and join in our caroling sing-a-long. 

The event is FREE but registration is required to ensure that we have enough materials for everyone to participate.

Please consider bringing a donation for the North Hills Backpack Initiative. Single serve items such as macaroni and cheese, ramen, applesauce, oatmeal, pudding, peanut butter crackers, fruit snacks and granola bars would be greatly appreciated.
Registration deadline is December 7th.
