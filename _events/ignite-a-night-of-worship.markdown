Let's GATHER the FAMILY for a night of worship.
A free dinner starts at 6p and night of non-traditional worship songs and vision for NHCC's future begins at 7p.

"Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us give thanks, by which we offer to God an acceptable worship with reverence and awe; for indeed our God is a consuming fire." 
-Hebrews 12:28-29
