sundays text: "NHCC Family & Friends -- wow. SO much continues to change and evolve
  as we navigate this time together.As we've previously communicated, leadership has
  continued to be in touch with medical professionals in our community, and is seeking
  to comply with all public health guidance and protocols. Consistent with this information, **NHCC
  is suspending all face-to-face group gatherings until further notice.**\n\nAs we've
  said from the beginning, we firmly believe this response we're adopting is what
  Christ-driven loving and serving looks like for us right now. This is not about
  fear, nor about personal self-preservation; this is simply how we best protect,
  care for and love our own: our community and even our nation, as well as the weakest
  and most vulnerable among us. If you are someone particularly vulnerable during
  this time and could use some help (or know someone in our midst who does), please
  reach out to staff or elders and let us know, so that we can connect resources with
  needs. If you are reading this and don't yet fully understand the gravity of this
  situation, or still believe responses like ours are an overreaction, there are Christ-following
  individuals in the medical field that have resources to share, and have even offered
  to reach out and shed some light on the subject for you. Reach out to me and I will
  connect you with what they can offer.  Here is how all of this impacts us as a church
  and what our \"new normal\" will look like for now:\n\nEach Sunday morning  you
  will all receive an email with a video link to our service. (If you don't use email,
  but have a text-capable phone, you will receive a text link to the video). We will
  also aim to make this video available on our website. The video will include worship,
  message and communion, all of which each of us can engage with in our own homes
  together. If the \"online church\" format is a new or cumbersome concept for you,
  and you could use some help, let us know. We have people that would love to help
  walk you through it so that you can engage with us...we don't want anyone to be
  left out!\n\nFor communion, you have 2 options: you can either use bread/crackers
  and juice you may have at home, OR, you may come to the church during the week and
  pickup the communion elements. We have pre-sealed fully contained communion packets
  that are setup at a small station under the roof of our main church entrance...
  simply come by at your leisure and take enough sets for your family to use for that
  week. The station will be setup in such a way that the pre-wrapped sets will not
  be touched by mass-handling.\n\nFor offering, please be encouraged to use Tithely,
  our mobile platform. You can access Tithely from the Giving Section on our Community
  page. If you are unsure how to do this or how it works, contact me and I will make
  sure someone walks you through that process. Alternatively, you can always mail
  checks to the church office at 778 Thompson Run Rd, Pittsburgh PA 15237, OR, you
  can simply come by the church during daylight hours and drop it off. The lower door
  will be open, and a locked slotted donation box will be right inside, along with
  some giving envelopes and hand sanitizer. In times such as ours, please do not underestimate
  the importance of loving and serving through giving financially. Paul, talking about
  Macedonian churches, writes \"In the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing
  joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity...they gave as much as
  they were able, and even beyond their ability\" (2 Corinthians 8:2-3). Their joy informed
  their generosity. Nehemiah 8:10 says, \"Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is
  your strength.” We have the opportunity to find that same strength, through that
  same source of joy, to propel us to love, serve and give generously in this unique
  time.\n \nFamilies and kids--Katie will regularly be interacting with you and getting
  materials into your hands, and Jeff-- well, Jeff and our teens are already naturally
  living and interacting in the online world quite effectively--but Jeff will be looking
  for additional resources to connect with our Jr/Sr High students. Our hope is to
  equip everyone to engage with us at home as best as we can, while continuing to
  look for ways to love each other and love our communities well during this extraordinary
  time.\n\nInconveniencing ourselves in order to love, protect and care for the most
  vulnerable among us is paramount to living out the Gospel. Please make use of our
  email at prayer@northhillschristian.church to share requests and needs, and we will
  continue to stay connected and keep everyone informed as we all navigate this together.\n\nEthan
  Harrington\n(Lead Pastor)"

    that share similar beliefs and practices.

    with a cup of your favorite drink--or have one of ours--and wear whatever makes
    you feel comfortable. '

  answer: Yes. All of our adult volunteers have their background checks and are in
    compliance with federal and state laws. Kids will also be escorted back to their
    class with their loving adult volunteers.
- question: Do I have to be a member to join a group?
  answer: No. We invite everyone searching for a place to gather, learn and serve
    to join us at any of the groups and events we have throughout the year. Check
    out our [groups page](/groups) for a place to plug in.
