  Sundays are the core of our gathering, learning and serving. NHCC believes being a Jesus follower means meeting and learning together.

  On Sundays our entire church family gathers to worship through song; learn from the teachings of the Bible; partake in communion; give to the church and those in need through our offering; and serve wherever we might be needed.

  Sundays also provide an opportunity for our Kids and Students to learn and serve. Our dedicated staff and volunteers have tailored a worship experience that is engaging and safe for the whole family.
