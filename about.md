sundays_text: Sundays are the core of our gathering, learning and serving.


  On Sundays our entire church family gathers to worship through song; learn from the teachings of the Bible; partake in communion; give to the church and those in need through our offering; and serve wherever we might be needed.


  Sundays also provide an opportunity for our Kids and Students to learn and serve. Our dedicated staff and volunteers have tailored a worship experience that is engaging and safe for the whole family.
