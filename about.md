  Sundays are the core of our gathering, learning and serving. NHCC believes being a Jesus follower means meeting and learning together.

  On Sundays our entire church family gathers to worship through song; learn from the teachings of the Bible; partake in communion; give to the church and those in need through our offering; and serve wherever we might be needed.

  Sundays also provide an opportunity for our Kids and Students to learn and serve. Our dedicated staff and volunteers have tailored a worship experience that is engaging and safe for the whole family.

faq:
- question: Are you a part of any denomination?
  answer: No. We do not have a governing body, dioceses or presbytery. NHCC is an
    autonomous, non-denominational congregation of all backgrounds, but we are associated
    with nearly 5,000 other Christian Churches/Churches of Christ across the world
    that share similar beliefs and practices.
