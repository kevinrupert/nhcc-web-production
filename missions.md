NHCC believes Jesus followers should make more Jesus followers. We do this by supporting and serving local and global mission organizations and their workers. Every few years, NHCC also provides the opportunity for our congregation to participate in domestic and international mission trips that challenge our Jesus followers to be servants of others.
