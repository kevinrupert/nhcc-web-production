  Teaching Team at NHCC is dedicated to the physical, spiritual and emotional care of children from birth through 5th grade. Our goal is to provide Biblical teaching and experiences that will encourage children to develop lifelong relationships with Jesus Christ. It is our desire to develop individuals who display Christ like character, understand a Biblical worldview, and demonstrate hearts of service.

  Caring for your children is a big responsibility, which is why we employ a national background check company to assure the safety of all teaching volunteers over the age of 18.
